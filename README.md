# COMP341-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence

# Course Description
An undergraduate course to introduce the foundations of modern artificial intelligence, geared
towards building systems and agents that can reason, learn, and adapt to solve problems.
Students will be exposed to search, constraint satisfaction, logic, uncertainty, machine learning
and Markov decision processes with examples from vision, robotics, language, and games.
# Course Objectives
1. To provide a broad survey of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
2. To prepare students for the advanced courses related to AI
3. To have students develop design and programming skills to create AI systems and agents
# Learning Outcomes
1. Understand basic principles of agent-based AI and computational decision making
2. Analyze a problem, use the right representation, formulation, and the method to solve it
3. Know about models and their use in solving AI methods
4. Know the basic concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and how it relates to AI
5. Understand sources of uncertainty, representing uncertainty and decision making under
uncertainty

# Assignment 1 - Search
I successfully implemented and tested key search algorithms — Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search, A* Search, and various problem-specific strategies — within the Pacman game framework, demonstrating efficient pathfinding and problem-solving capabilities in complex environments.

# Assignment 2 - Multiagent
I enhanced a Pacman Reflex Agent, implemented Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms for adversarial search, developed an Expectimax Agent for probabilistic scenarios, and designed a sophisticated evaluation function. This work involved optimizing Pacman's decision-making in various complex game environments, demonstrating advanced concepts in AI and game theory.

# Assignment 3 - Ghostbuster
I developed a range of algorithms for probabilistic inference and tracking in a dynamic environment, using the Pacman game as a testbed. This involved enhancing a reflex agent, implementing various search strategies including Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax, and constructing complex particle filters for joint distribution tracking, all of which culminated in a comprehensive exploration of AI techniques for decision making and inference in uncertain environments.
