# COMP341-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence

# Course Description
An undergraduate course to introduce the foundations of modern artificial intelligence, geared
towards building systems and agents that can reason, learn, and adapt to solve problems.
Students will be exposed to search, constraint satisfaction, logic, uncertainty, machine learning
and Markov decision processes with examples from vision, robotics, language, and games.
# Course Objectives
1. To provide a broad survey of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
2. To prepare students for the advanced courses related to AI
3. To have students develop design and programming skills to create AI systems and agents
# Learning Outcomes
1. Understand basic principles of agent-based AI and computational decision making
2. Analyze a problem, use the right representation, formulation, and the method to solve it
3. Know about models and their use in solving AI methods
4. Know the basic concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and how it relates to AI
5. Understand sources of uncertainty, representing uncertainty and decision making under
uncertainty

**Search**
In this homework for 'COMP341 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,' I successfully implemented and tested key search algorithms — Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search, A* Search, and various problem-specific strategies — within the Pacman game framework, demonstrating efficient pathfinding and problem-solving capabilities in complex environments.
